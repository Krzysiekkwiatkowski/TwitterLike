It's application similar to twitter. It gives it's users posobility to see all/post tweets, make comments and send some messages to others. Can also change some less important informations, password or delete theirs accounts. This application was made with Spring and Hibernate, to practise it's mechanics. It show views in JSP, data is stored in MySQL database, password is secure and check by JBCrypt utilities. For now it will not be improved.
